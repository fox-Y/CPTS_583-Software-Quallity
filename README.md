# CPTS_583-Software-Quallity Project
# Electornic Voting System



You will be developing an electronic voting system that enables voters to vote securely from                           
remote sites (rather than centralized polling sites). The system should be configurable allowing                         
users to specify candidates, total votes available, date range for voting, and the winning                           
number of votes reaching which the winning candidate can be determined without waiting until                           
all votes are casted (think about the presidential election process). 
 
You are expected to build either a desktop application or web-based implementation that is                           
robust, user-friendly, and deployable. The system should include a user interface showing the                         
voting results (e.g., the final votes each candidate received and the winning candidate, and                           
possibly the vote statistics by geographic locations or political regions) for which visualizations                         
can be employed to enhance the understanding of results.
